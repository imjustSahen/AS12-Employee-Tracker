## <ins>General info

My task was to build an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in a database, also referred to as a Content Management System (CMS). 

## <ins>Description

<li>User is able to run 'node server.js' to start the application</li>
<li>User is able to select from a variety of options to view, create, or update company profiles</li>
<li>Once a user is done viewing, creating, and updating comany profile options they can then easily exit the application</li>
